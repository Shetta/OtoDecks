# OtoDecks
Creating a C++ DJ App using JUCE Library.

# Contribution
The University of London, Goldsmiths have created the MainComponent, DeckGUI, DJAudioPlayer, and WaveformDisplay barebones, all of which I have modified. The nature of these changes mostly affect the GUI or enabled the implementation of my own code. These changes include but are not limited to changing the layout of components, adding labels to sliders, adding the song name to the waveform, adding a reverb audio source, and defining event listener callbacks. The University also started a rough outline of the Playlist Component files which I finished and ultimately wrote the majority of. The rest of the components are solely my work.

## Features
[See my tutorial of the application on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9INsfCMy-M)
- Directly load a song into each deck or import a library to load from any source in your file system.
- Change volume, speed, and position.
- Delete a song if needed.
- Search for a specific song.
- Playing with the frequency and duration of each deck.
- Displays the file name and a waveform of the track/
